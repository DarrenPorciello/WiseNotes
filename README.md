### How WiseNotes Works

WiseNotes utilizes the power of Axios, Body Parser, CORS, dotenv, Express, Node-fetch, and the OpenAI API to create a robust system that automates the note-taking process. The server is set up using `server.js`, and you can start the server using `npm start` or `npm run dev` for development with nodemon.
